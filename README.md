# Jammming

A React web app that lets users search the Spotify API, create custom playlists,
and save them to their Spotify account.


API Note
This project uses Apple’s iTunes Search API as a substitute for the Spotify Web API due to temporary restrictions on new Spotify developer integrations. The application architecture remains API-agnostic and can be extended to OAuth-based providers.
